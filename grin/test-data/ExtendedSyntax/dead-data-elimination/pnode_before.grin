{-
  Heap locations have way too general type sets.
  This is due to the fact that apply can produce
  many differenct node types.
  (All partial applications and return values of all functions).
  apply is called by ap, which is called by eval.
  This means that all pointers will have this overly general type information.
  So for example the second argument of foo could be CInt or any Pfoo node.
  As a consequence, since foo's return value is the return value of grinMain,
  all partial applications of foo will be completely live (this is not intended).

  Eval inlining + apply inlining should solve this issue.
